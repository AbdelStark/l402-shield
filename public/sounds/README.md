# Sound Files

These placeholder files should be replaced with real sound effects:

- `coin.mp3` - Sound played when credits are added (coin insertion sound)
- `click.mp3` - Sound played when a button is clicked
- `success.mp3` - Sound played when block data is successfully retrieved

You can find royalty-free arcade sounds on sites like:
