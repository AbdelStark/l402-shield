# L402 Shield

A retro arcade-style web application that demonstrates the L402 protocol (Lightning HTTP 402) by integrating Lightning Network payments into a fun, nostalgic interface.

## Overview

L402 Shield showcases how to implement the Lightning HTTP 402 Protocol (L402) for API monetization. The app interacts with a backend that provides three main endpoints:

- `/signup` - to obtain an auth token
- `/info` - to retrieve user credits
- `/block` - to get the latest Bitcoin block data (requires payment if out of credits)

The application follows a vintage arcade game theme with neon colors, pixelated fonts, and playful audio-visual feedback.

## Features

- **Retro Arcade UI**: Styled with neon colors, pixelated fonts, and arcade-style animations
- **Token-based Authentication**: Sign up to receive an auth token
- **Credit System**: Track your credits in a coin-based counter
- **Lightning Payments**: When out of credits, scan a QR code with a Lightning wallet to pay
- **Block Explorer**: View the latest Bitcoin block information

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ or latest LTS
- A Lightning wallet for testing payments

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

3. Configure the backend URL:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8080"
   ```

   Replace the URL with your backend server address.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
